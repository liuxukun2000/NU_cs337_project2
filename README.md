## Installation and Steup
Get the required packages through requirements.txt. 

## Main Features
This recipe parser takes URLs from allrecipes.com, delish.com, and bonappetit.com, parses the recipes and provides the user with an interactive chatbot. We have done relatively little testing for bonappetit.com, so results for this website may be worse than for the other two. 

For the convenience of grading, there is the option to see the full parse, including all the variables we extracted from the steps. To see this, choose option 3 in the menu. Furthermore, there are still some features of the parser that we were unable to write handlers for. For example, we extracted the position of all of the ingredients within a step, and the steps that involve a particular ingredient. 

All of the required features were implemented and tested. For the types of questions it can answer, refer to the assignment document or the demo video.
